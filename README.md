Twitter Sentiment Analysis is our Database Technologies project which analyzes the sentiment of tweets in both real-time (streaming) and batch processing modes. 
It utilizes Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion, Apache Spark for data processing, TextBlob for sentiment analysis, and MySQL for data storage. 
The project allows for performance comparison between streaming and batch modes, showcasing the strengths and trade-offs of each approach.
